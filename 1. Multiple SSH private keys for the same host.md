# 1.Multiple SSH private keys for the same host

1. If you already have the default key configured, go to step 2. Otherwise, [Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

   ```
   $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@youremail.com"
   
   # start the ssh-agent in the background
   $ eval `ssh-agent -s`
   
   # you can delete all cached keys before
   $ ssh-add -D
   
   # add keys as following
   $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   
   # you can check your saved keys
   $ ssh-add -l
   ```

2. Generate another key for the same host (of different account) and configure it in file `~/.ssh/config`. There is no need to add this key to the agent.

    ```
    # Use account_2 (and account_3 ...) as the host to access the repository
    Host account_2
        HostName github.com
        User git
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_account_2
        IdentitiesOnly yes
    ```

3. [Add the public key to GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account), then [Testing your SSH connection](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/testing-your-ssh-connection)

    ```
    $ ssh -T git@github.com
    $ ssh -T git@account_2
    ```

4. Now you are all set to clone your repositories, with the host configured in `~/.ssh/config` file

   ```
   $ git clone git@account_2:org2/project2.git /path/to/project2
   ```

   or change the remote origin in the `.git/config` file after cloning

   ```
   [remote "origin"]
           url = git@account_2:org2/project2.git
   ```

   and the corresponding key will be used for different repository. 

#### PS.

   * If you are using Git Extensions, just specify OpenSSH as the ssh client in Settings.

   * If security is not your concern, specify no passphrase when create keys will save you much of time.

   * If you are using Putty, then 

     1. generate keys via putty directly (and export as OpenSSH keys if necessary), rather than import OpenSSH keys and do the conversion, which may cause issues.

     2. pay attention to the type of key to generate, e.g. RSA or Ed25519.

     3. you can debug the connection via command `plink -v git@github.com`
